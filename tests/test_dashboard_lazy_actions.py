"""The action bar is built for the rows on screen, and on touch for the rest.

Nine controls a row across 4,191 rows was most of a 7.2MB document and around
60,000 nodes, every one built before the browser would paint, for rows nobody
had scrolled to. Measured on Callum's board: 98,009 nodes to 59,158 and 7.2MB
to 5.2MB, with `domContentLoaded` 1,258ms to 802ms.

The risk this introduces is drift. Two renderers of one control is exactly how
this dashboard once shipped a status menu offering two of its ten statuses, so
the Python that writes the eager rows and the JavaScript that builds the lazy
ones are checked against each other here.
